{"name":"close-enough-judge","score":null,"metadata":{"rationale":"1) Identify expected: the expected result is the numeral '4', which represents the integer 4.\n2) Identify output: the candidate output is the word 'four', which is the English lexical representation of the same integer.\n3) Semantic comparison: 'four' and '4' denote the same value; under semantic or normalized numeric evaluation they are equivalent.\n4) Token/string exact-match consideration: as raw strings they differ ('four' != '4'), so under a strict exact-byte/string-match metric they would score 0.\n5) Typical evaluation practice: most evaluation for numeric answers either normalize number words and digits or compare numeric value; in that common case they match perfectly.\nConclusion: under a sensible normalization/numeric equivalence metric the match is perfect, so score 1.0; under strict raw string match it would be 0.0. I choose the normalized/numeric-equivalence interpretation.","choice":"1.0"}}
