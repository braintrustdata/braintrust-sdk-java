{"name":"close-enough-judge","score":null,"metadata":{"rationale":"1) Identify the expected result: the expected output is the numeral '4'.\n2) Identify the actual output: the model produced the word 'four'.\n3) Normalize both outputs for semantic comparison: convert spelled-out numbers to their numeric value (\"four\" -> 4) and interpret numerals as numbers (\"4\" -> 4).\n4) Compare normalized values: 4 == 4, so they are semantically identical.\n5) Consider common evaluation schemes: strict string match would mark them as different (score 0.0), while numeric/semantic normalization would treat them as equivalent (score 1.0). Given typical LLM evals that allow normalization of number formats, the correct score is 1.0.\n6) Provide final numeric score accordingly.","choice":"1.0"}}
