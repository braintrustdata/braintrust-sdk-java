{"name":"close-enough-judge","score":null,"metadata":{"rationale":"1) Identify semantic meaning: the token 'four' is the English word representing the integer 4.\n2) Compare to expected: '4' is the numeric digit for the same integer.\n3) Normalization: Under common evaluation normalization (case-insensitive, number-word normalization), these are equivalent.\n4) Edge cases: If the grader requires exact string match without normalization, they'd be considered different; but typical semantic scoring treats them equal.\n5) Conclusion: semantically identical in standard evaluations, so full score is appropriate.","choice":"1.0"}}
